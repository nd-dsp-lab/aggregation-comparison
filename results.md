# Benchmark Results

Measures average round aggregation time in Î¼s over 1,000 rounds of aggregation.

## Platform Descriptions

- **Native:** AES decryption and summation of each cipher text run without SGX.

- **SGX:** AES decryption and summation of each cipher text run inside SGX.

- **TERSE-Native:** TERSE run entirely without SGX.

- **TERSE-SGX:** TERSE run entirely in SGX.

- **TERSE-Hybrid (ours):** Most summations run outside of SGX. Lookup and final addition run inside SGX.

## Results

| Number of Devices | Native    | SGX       | TERSE-Native | TERSE-SGX | TERSE-Hybrid |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| 1,000             | 795.18    | 607.61    | 1.44         | 26.68     | 0.94         |

## Notes

- Results at 1,000 devices may exhibit timing artifacts due to measurement precision at microsecond scales. Focus on 10,000+ device results for reliable comparisons.
